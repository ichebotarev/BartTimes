## An App to Show the Next Train for Each Line 
I use bart pretty often and find myself going to real time departures and almost no other part of the site, and often really only looking at the when the next train is departing.
I personally dont really like the look and feel of the site, so I decided to create an app that was simplified in appearance and use to my needs. 

## To Be Implemented
I think in some instances I would like to have a second train, however with how nested my logic is I am probably going to have to take a step back and reanalyze before going deeper. 

Some More styling for the times section.
